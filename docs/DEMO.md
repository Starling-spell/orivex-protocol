# Three-minute demo

## Before presenting

Run `npm run genlayer:check`, `npm run genlayer:publish`, and `npm run build`. Start the localhost server. Open `/#deploy`, load the examples and confirm the receipt exports open. Keep `docs/RESULTS.md` and the terminal ready. The saved receipts support inspection during an RPC outage; label them as saved results if the live check fails.

## Presentation

| Time | Screen and action | Explain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00–0:25 | Agent lab | Agents make claims. Consumers need evidence and a judgment they can inspect. |
| 0:25–0:55 | License Scout | The claim and criterion are visible. Open the commit-pinned license. Show its SHA-256. |
| 0:55–1:25 | Recheck onchain | Read the deployed source, finalized receipt and proof; reproduce the commitment. |
| 1:25–1:50 | Ownership Reviewer and Release Inspector | The same contract evaluates source behavior and release metadata through distinct local agent programs. |
| 1:50–2:20 | False Claim Control and Provenance Control | Explain refutation versus insufficient evidence. Show the actual receipt statuses. |
| 2:20–2:45 | Full receipt JSON and terminal | Show execution success, MAJORITY_AGREE, assigned votes, and the reproducible hash. Idle validators are not counted as agreeing. |
| 2:45–3:00 | Scope and next milestone | The shipped primitive is evidence judgment; authenticated agent identity and Base integration are future work. |

Do not wait for ten new transactions during a three-minute pitch. Use the completed examples, then run a live read check. For a longer technical session, run `npm run genlayer:examples` to demonstrate its resume behavior; existing references do not mint duplicate proofs.

## Questions to expect

**Where is the AI?** In the GenLayer intelligent contract's nondeterministic prompt evaluation. The local example agents are small deterministic programs that extract data and propose claims.

**Why not a centralized LLM?** Consumers can inspect the contract policy and network consensus receipt; the application does not get to stamp its own result. Model/provider correlations remain a limitation.

**Are the agents onchain identities?** No. Their claims, submitter address and judgments are onchain. Their names identify local example programs controlled by one operator.

**What does SUCCESS guarantee?** Agreement that the evidence supports the submitted claim under its criterion. It does not prove general competence, authentic authorship, audit completion or external causation.

**Can I change the document after verification?** A changed document will not reproduce the committed digest. Evidence is also pinned by source URL. Availability and factual authenticity are separate questions.

**Can I get a false claim approved?** Model errors and weak criteria remain possible. Controls demonstrate specific tested cases, not a universal soundness guarantee. Consumers need a reviewed policy and risk-appropriate evidence sources.

**Does it update reputation on Base?** No. The Base contracts remain a separate prototype and no bridge is configured.

**Is StudioNet a production blockchain?** It is GenLayer's hosted development environment. Transactions and consensus executions are real within that environment; the deployment is not a production release.
